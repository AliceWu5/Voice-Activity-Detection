This repo is for voice activity detection algorithm (VAD). This code is based on this paper:

Ramırez, Javier, José C. Segura, Carmen Benıtez, Angel De La Torre, and Antonio Rubio. 
   "Efficient voice activity detection algorithms using long-term speech information." 
                       
And the Matlab code version (Thanks for the isrish making such a beautiful program):

This cpp file take input audio data from txt file and write results to 'example*.txt' file. At the end, I use gnuplot to plot the result and it works exactly the same as the Matlab Code from isrish.
